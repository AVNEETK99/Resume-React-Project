                In my role as a Team Lead at GeeksforGeeks, I successfully managed a team of 10-15 professionals, collaborating on various tasks such as
                resolving student queries, developing problems, projects, and courses. Leveraging my expertise in Python, Networking, SQL, Databases, Data
                Security, Data Structures, and Data Science, I created comprehensive and practical courses catering to a diverse range of technical areas.
                Some of the courses I developed include Python Course, Python Crash Course, Python Project Course (beginner to advanced level), Python Ursina
                Project Course, C++ Course, and Database Management Course. Additionally, I curated question sets for coding competitions and data visualization
                courses, ensuring an engaging learning experience.
                As a mentor, I actively organized coding competitions and motivated students to explore various Python libraries like Pygame, Ursina, Tkinter, Sys,
                Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pytorch. By doing so, I aimed to provide students with a holistic understanding of the Python language and its
                applications.Moreover, I expanded my scope by developing courses on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, focusing on web development. These courses
                covered fundamental concepts, React component-based architecture, and HTML/CSS styling techniques, empowering students to build modern and
                dynamic web applications.Throughout my tenure, my dedication to delivering a professional and enriching learning experience, coupled with my passion for teaching and
                comprehensive technical knowledge, enabled me to develop courses and contests of exceptional quality.
