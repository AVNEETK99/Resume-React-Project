Leveraging my expertise in Python, Networking, SQL, Databases, Data Security, Data Structures, and Data Science, I created comprehensive and practical courses catering to a diverse range of technical areas. Some of the courses I developed include Python Course, Python Crash Course, Python Project Course (beginner to advanced level), Python Ursina Project Course, C++ Course, and Database Management Course. Additionally, I curated question sets for coding competitions and data visualization courses, ensuring an engaging learning experience. As a mentor, I actively organized coding competitions and motivated students to explore various Python libraries like Pygame, Ursina, Tkinter, Sys, Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pytorch. By doing so, I aimed to provide students with a holistic understanding of the Python language and its applications.Moreover, I expanded my scope by developing courses on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, focusing on web development. These courses covered fundamental concepts, React component-based architecture, and HTML/CSS styling techniques, empowering students to build modern and dynamic web applications.Throughout my tenure, my dedication to delivering a professional and enriching learning experience, coupled with my passion for teaching and comprehensive technical knowledge, enabled me to develop courses and contests of exceptional quality.\")))), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"div\", {\n    className: \"row mt-top\",\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 42,\n      columnNumber: 11\n    }\n  }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"div\", {\n    className: \"col xl4 l4 m6 s12\",\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 43,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }\n  }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"p\", {\n    className: \"teal year_exp white-text\",\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 44,\n      columnNumber: 15\n    }\n  }, \"Aug\", /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"strong\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 46,\n      columnNumber: 17\n    }\n  }, \"2020\"), \" - Dec\", /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"strong\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 47,\n      columnNumber: 17\n    }\n  }, \"2021\"))), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"div\", {\n    className: \"col xl8 l8 m6 s12\",\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 50,\n      columnNumber: 13\n    }\n  }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"blockquote\", {\n    className: \"no-pad\",\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 51,\n      columnNumber: 15\n    }\n  }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"h6\", {\n    className: \"no-pad mt-bottom\",\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 52,\n      columnNumber: 17\n    }\n  }, /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"strong\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 53,\n      columnNumber: 19\n    }\n  }, \"Coding Instructor\")), /*#__PURE__*/React.createElement(\"p\", {\n    __self: this,\n    __source: {\n      fileName: _jsxFileName,\n      lineNumber: 55,\n      columnNumber: 17\n    }\n  }, \"As an instructor at Qin1, I had the opportunity to teach more than 400 classes to students ranging from 6 to 18 years old.

Leveraging my expertise in Python, Networking, SQL, Databases, Data\n                Security, Data Structures, and Data Science, I created comprehensive and practical courses catering to a diverse range of technical areas.\n                Some of the courses I developed include Python Course, Python Crash Course, Python Project Course (beginner to advanced level), Python Ursina\n                Project Course, C++ Course, and Database Management Course. Additionally, I curated question sets for coding competitions and data visualization\n                courses, ensuring an engaging learning experience.\n                As a mentor, I actively organized coding competitions and motivated students to explore various Python libraries like Pygame, Ursina, Tkinter, Sys,\n                Pandas, Matplotlib, Numpy, and Pytorch. By doing so, I aimed to provide students with a holistic understanding of the Python language and its\n                applications.Moreover, I expanded my scope by developing courses on HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS, focusing on web development. These courses\n                covered fundamental concepts, React component-based architecture, and HTML/CSS styling techniques, empowering students to build modern and\n                dynamic web applications.Throughout my tenure, my dedication to delivering a professional and enriching learning experience, coupled with my passion for teaching and\n                comprehensive technical knowledge, enabled me to develop courses and contests of exceptional quality.\n\n                </p>\n              </blockquote>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div className=\"row mt-top\">\n            <div className=\"col xl4 l4 m6 s12\">\n              <p className=\"teal year_exp white-text\">\n                Aug\n                <strong>2020</strong> - Dec\n                <strong>2021</strong>\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <div className=\"col xl8 l8 m6 s12\">\n              <blockquote className=\"no-pad\">\n                <h6 className=\"no-pad mt-bottom\">\n                  <strong>Coding Instructor</strong>\n                </h6>\n                <p>\n                As an instructor at Qin1, I had the opportunity to teach more than 400 classes to students ranging from 6 to 18 years old.
